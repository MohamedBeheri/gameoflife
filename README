Game of Life

------------
Introduction
------------
A simple, multithreaded implementation of the Game of Life created by John Conway. The code is written in ANSI C (-ansi and -pedantic return no warnings).

This implementation was created as an assignment in a course on Operating Systems at State University of Campinas, Brazil.

This program is free software and is licensed under the GNU Public License, version 3.

--------
Building
--------
The program has only been (not so extensively) tested on Linux, under a 2.6+ kernel with NPTL. Feel free to try to run it under a BSD, for example.

Requirements
  The program only requires the GNU libc. In fact, other standard C libraries might work, as long as they provide a POSIX threads implementation.
  If you intend to generate the documentation for the project, you need doxygen and graphviz.

Compilation
  To compile the program you just need to run 'make'.
  To generate the documentation, you need to run 'make doc'.

-----
Usage
-----
The program must be invoked from command line and has two required parameters: the number of generations for which to run and the file containing the seed board (the initial board state).

Example:
  glife 3 board.txt

This should read the file board.txt, use it as the initial board state and then run the program for 3 generations.

-----------------
Board file format
-----------------
Currently, this implementation only supports its own very simple file format.

The first line must consist of the string 'Rows:' followed by a positive integer R that will be used as the number of rows in the board.

The second line must consist of the string 'Cols:' followed by a positive integer C that will be used as the number of columns in the board.

The following R lines of the file must consist of C characters that should be either '.' or '#', the former representing a dead cell and the latter representing a living cell.
